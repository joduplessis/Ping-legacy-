# Ping (legacy)

Ping was a social alarm clock app that lost steam, fell to the ground and burned up in a fiery death. This was almost entirely due to the fact that building an alarm app for iOS & certain extent Android is a pain as permissions will not permit you commandeering a user's phone screen when idle. Irritating, I know. I've added the project files here for myself (as a backup) and for anybody remotely interested in perusing the code.

## Android app

This is the core app (unfinished) targeting 4.4 based devices. Correct, it's not iOS (which was the end goal).

## API

Laravel based API. Can confirm, really nice framework.

## Chrome extension

Chrome extension interacting with API to pull pings.

## Snooze server

When a person presses snooze, they interact with a real time NodeJS server. Why I opted for this instead of Firebase, I may never know.

## Installation & setup

Familiarity with Node/NPM/Yarn, Gradle/Android & Composer/PHP is helpful.
